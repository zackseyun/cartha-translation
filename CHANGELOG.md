## Phase 8 corpus rescue update — 2026-04-21

Follow-up quality work on the deuterocanonical corpus after the first
Phase 8 release.

- **Sirach rescue completed**: the final `low` verses were not true
  paleographic dead ends; they were page-targeting / numbering failures.
  The rescue was corrected to the actual scan pages:
  - `SIR 3:5, 3:7` → vol2 p665
  - `SIR 33:14–16` → vol2 p728
  - `SIR 33:17` → vol2 p734
- **ADE 4:28 corrected from the scan**: direct page recheck showed that
  Swete prints the line **without** `ἐπὶ` before `τράπεζαν Ἁμάν`; the
  verse was promoted from `medium` to `high`.
- **Residual state after rescue**: **6,335 high**, **2 medium**,
  **0 low** in the current final corpus.
- **Remaining honest residuals**:
  - `BAR 1:1` — breathing/orthography-level ambiguity still too small to
    promote beyond `medium`
  - `1ES 9:35` — exposed as part of a wider tail-block verse-numbering
    drift in 1 Esdras 9, not just an isolated one-verse uncertainty
- **Method now documented**: see
  `docs/PHASE8_CORPUS_QUALITY_RESCUE.md` for the repeatable rescue loop
  used to make these improvements.

## Phase 8 corpus milestone — 2026-04-20

LXX deuterocanonical source text ready for Phase 9 drafting. This is
a corpus release, not a translation release — no English verses ship
from Phase 8 itself.

- **Scope**: 13 deuterocanonical books, 6,337 verses total.
- **Transcription**: our own OCR of Swete 1909 (Public Domain) via
  Azure GPT-5 vision, released under CC-BY 4.0.
- **Adjudication**: scan-grounded verdicts against 4 independent
  transcriptions (ours, First1KGreek, Rahlfs-Hanhart, Amicarelli) for
  3,464 verses where our OCR disagreed with at least one witness.
- **Confidence after all rescue passes**: **98.9% high** (3,425), 1.1%
  medium (39), **0% low** — no verses left in an unverified state.
- **Rescue passes** (iteratively):
  1. `rescue_low_conf.py` — 4-source re-adjudication at 3000px scan
     resolution for every initially low/medium verse.
  2. Fixed image-fetch silent-failure bug and a page-metadata bug
     affecting Greek Esther Additions and Tobit chapter 14.
  3. `rescue_hebrew_parallel.py` — 5-source rescue adding Hebrew
     witness (Sefaria Kahana for SIR, Neubauer 1878 for TOB, WLC MT
     parallel for 1ES) to 14 verses in 1ES 5/6/8/9 + SIR 3/40.
  4. `rescue_low_conf_focused.py` — content-based per-verse page
     identification, targeting the final 32 low-conf verses in
     ADE/TOB with a single focused scan per verse. All 32 promoted
     to high with 0 failures.
- **Quality benchmark** (vs First1KGreek as independent validation
  oracle): 72.3% strict agreement, 86.1% functional agreement. 806
  "major" differences verified by the scan adjudicator as legitimate
  Swete (diplomatic Vaticanus) vs First1KGreek (eclectic) textual-
  tradition divergences, not OCR errors. Published in
  `sources/lxx/swete/QUALITY_BENCHMARK.md`.
- **Per-book 100%-high**: WIS, 3MA, 4MA, LJE, ADA. All other books ≥ 97%.
- **Hebrew/MT parallels vendored** (`sources/lxx/hebrew_parallels/`):
  Sefaria Ben Sira (CC0, 1,018/1,019 verses), Sefaria Tobit Neubauer
  1878 (PD, 76/76 verses), 1 Esdras → MT alignment table. Accessible
  via `tools/hebrew_parallels.py::lookup_with_consult`.
- **Yadin 1965 Masada Ben Sira scroll** (Zone 2 consult, per
  REFERENCE_SOURCES.md): a copy of the editio princeps is consulted
  during Sirach drafting. 413 Sirach verses indexed across chs
  4, 39-44, 49, 51 with 100% coverage of the Sir 39:27-44:17 scroll
  range. Consulted via `tools/yadin_masada.py::lookup`; nothing from
  this work appears in COB output or is committed to the repository.
- **Three-zone reference policy** formalized in REFERENCE_SOURCES.md;
  deferred-source integration documented in REVISION_LATER.md.
