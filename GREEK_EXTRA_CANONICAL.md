# Greek extra-canonical pipeline — Group A

This document covers the **shared Greek pipeline** for the
extra-canonical texts that can reuse our existing Greek OCR /
transcription workflow with little or no architectural change.

It complements:

- [`EXTRA_CANONICAL.md`](EXTRA_CANONICAL.md) — the full roadmap
- [`PSALMS_OF_SOLOMON.md`](PSALMS_OF_SOLOMON.md) — the first exercised
  book in this group
- [`REFERENCE_SOURCES.md`](REFERENCE_SOURCES.md) — source-policy rules

> **Status: pipeline-setup phase.** Psalms of Solomon has already
> exercised the Swete side of this stack. The next goal is to make the
> shared Greek OCR/transcription path ready for the remaining Group A
> texts.

## Which texts are in Group A

These are the extra-canonical Greek texts we currently intend to handle
with the same general stack:

| Text | Primary source situation | Shared pipeline note |
|---|---|---|
| **Psalms of Solomon** | Greek in Swete vol. III appendix | Already transcribed from Swete pp. 788–810 |
| **Didache** | Greek in Codex Hierosolymitanus tradition | Needs local-PDF Greek OCR |
| **1 Clement** | Greek (Alexandrinus + H54 tradition) | Needs local-PDF Greek OCR |
| **Shepherd of Hermas** | Greek primary, plus Latin and Ethiopic versions | Greek-first pipeline; later witnesses can layer in |
| **Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs** | Greek primary, with secondary versions | Greek-first pipeline; later witness work can follow |

## Why this group belongs together

Compared with the harder extra-canonical tracks:

- **No new script family** (still Greek)
- **No new OCR model choice problem** (Azure GPT-5 already works here)
- **No daughter-translation-first source architecture** like 2 Esdras
- **No Ge'ez / Coptic-specific validation layer**

That means the shared work is mostly:

1. source acquisition
2. page OCR / transcription
3. book-specific parsing
4. prompt-building
5. drafting

## Shared tooling

### Already available

- `tools/transcribe_source.py` — mature Swete-page Greek OCR
- `tools/prompts/transcribe_greek_swete.md` — Swete-specific Greek prompt
- `tools/psalms_of_solomon.py` — helper around the now-complete Swete
  page span for Psalms of Solomon

### Added for Group A

- `tools/greek_extra_pdf_ocr.py` — shared local-PDF Greek OCR for
  non-Swete public-domain editions
- `tools/prompts/transcribe_greek_extra_generic.md` — generic prompt
  for late-19th / early-20th century Greek scholarly editions
- `sources/greek_extra/README.md` — planned source-tree layout for the
  non-Swete Group A texts

## Planned source tree

```text
sources/greek_extra/
├── README.md
├── didache/
├── 1_clement/
├── shepherd_of_hermas/
└── testaments_twelve_patriarchs/
```

Psalms of Solomon stays under `sources/lxx/swete/transcribed/` because
its source already lives inside the Swete corpus.

## Work order inside the Greek pipeline

The shared Greek pipeline does **not** force a rigid book order, but it
does suggest a sensible sequence:

1. **Psalms of Solomon** — already transcribed, cheapest parser target
2. **Didache / 1 Clement** — shortest new-source Greek texts
3. **Shepherd of Hermas** — larger, but still same OCR stack
4. **Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs** — same stack, later parser work

This is effectively the practical bridge between the roadmap's Phase 13
and Phase 14.

## Immediate next steps

1. fetch / vendor the PD Greek editions for Didache, 1 Clement,
   Hermas, and Testaments
2. run the shared local-PDF Greek OCR pipeline on pilot pages
3. create one parser per book once page transcription stabilizes
4. begin drafting in the order above
