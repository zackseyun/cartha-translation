# Swete LXX — Vision-transcribed working text

Clean UTF-8 polytonic Greek transcribed from the Swete 1909–1930 scan
pages on Internet Archive via GPT-5.4 vision
(`tools/transcribe_source.py`).

## Files

- `vol{1,2,3}_p{NNNN}.txt` — verbatim transcription of a single scan
  page. Begins with `---SWETE-PAGE---` and ends with `---END-PAGE---`.
  Section markers: `[RUNNING HEAD]`, `[BODY]`, `[APPARATUS]`,
  `[MARGINALIA]`, `[PLATE]`, `[BLANK]`.
- `vol{1,2,3}_p{NNNN}.meta.json` — per-page provenance: image SHA-256,
  source URL on archive.org, model id, deployment, prompt version,
  timestamp, duration, output length.
- `page_index.json` — being built up as pages are transcribed: maps
  `vol` + `page` (scan page) → book code + chapter range + notes.
  Used by downstream code (planned `tools/lxx_swete.py`) to find which
  file holds a given book/chapter.

## Reproducing a transcription

The transcription is deterministic given the same image, prompt
version, and model deployment. To reproduce any page:

```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=... \
python3 tools/transcribe_source.py --source swete --vol 2 --page 60
```

The `meta.json` sidecar records the exact prompt version and model
deployment used, so a future rerun against the same scan image
(verifiable via `image_sha256`) can be compared to the current text.

## Scope

We prioritize the deuterocanonical sections of each volume:

- **Vol. II** — Tobit, Judith, Greek Additions to Esther, Wisdom of
  Solomon, Sirach.
- **Vol. III** — 1-4 Maccabees, Baruch + Letter of Jeremiah, Greek
  Additions to Daniel (Pr Azariah, Song of the Three, Susanna, Bel),
  Prayer of Manasseh, Psalm 151, and **Psalms of Solomon**
  (`vol3_p0788`–`vol3_p0810`).

The Protestant canonical books that Swete also contains (Genesis
through Malachi) are *not* a priority for vision transcription — those
books are drafted from SBLGNT (NT) and WLC/UHB (OT). They will be
transcribed later only as a cross-reference aid.
