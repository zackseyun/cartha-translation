# Swete LXX transcription — quality report

**Report date:** 2026-04-18
**Scope:** 572 scan pages covering the Phase 8 deuterocanonical corpus
across Swete vols II and III (see `page_index.json`).
**Methodology:** Azure GPT-5.4 vision (deployment `gpt-5-4-deployment`,
model `gpt-5.4-2026-03-05`) applied to archive.org scan JPEGs at 1500
px width, prompted per `tools/prompts/transcribe_greek_swete.md`
(prompt version `transcribe_v1_2026-04-18`). Every output page has a
paired `.meta.json` sidecar recording image SHA-256, source URL, model,
deployment, prompt version, timestamp — the run is reproducible.

This document is the baseline quality measurement, written before any
revision or second-pass work. Subsequent improvement passes will be
appended here with dated entries so the quality trajectory is visible.

## 1. Automated structural checks (all 617 transcribed pages)

Every transcribed page was statically analyzed. Findings:

### Format compliance — 100%

All 617 pages present the expected structure: `---SWETE-PAGE---`
header, at least one `[RUNNING HEAD]` / `[BODY]` / `[APPARATUS]` /
`[MARGINALIA]` / `[PLATE]` / `[BLANK]` section, `---END-PAGE---`
footer. Zero pages missing required delimiters.

### Character-class distribution

| Script | Characters | Share |
|---|---:|---:|
| Greek (polytonic) | 964,208 | 81.1% |
| ASCII (sigla, digits, format markers, punctuation) | 207,189 | 17.4% |
| Other (`ℵ`, `·`, modifier letters, superscripts, combining marks) | 17,239 | 1.4% |
| General punctuation (U+2010–U+206F) | 327 | ≪1% |
| Hebrew | 78 | ≪1% |

The 1.4% "other" is entirely legitimate: `ℵ` (U+2135 ALEF SYMBOL, the
Sinaiticus manuscript siglum, 1,026 occurrences), the Greek mid-dot
`·`, combining accents, superscript letters `ᵃ`/`ᵇ`/`ᶜ` marking
scribal hands, overlines for MS abbreviations.

Zero Cyrillic or Arabic script leaks.

### Issues flagged for post-processing

| Issue | Pages | Severity | Fix |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Decomposed Unicode (NFD instead of NFC) | 39 | cosmetic | one-line normalizer |
| Hebrew `א` (U+05D0) used where Swete prints `ℵ` (U+2135) as the Sinaiticus siglum | 11 | cosmetic | contextual replace in apparatus sections |
| Short `[BODY]` (<200 chars) | 5 | **none** — all are legitimate blank/plate/end-of-book pages the model correctly labeled | no action |

### Page-length distribution

Median 2,551 chars / page; mean 2,352; range 39–3,739. The 39-char
minimum is a `[BLANK]`-labeled end-matter page; the 3,739 maximum is a
dense apparatus-heavy page in Maccabees. No outliers suggesting
truncation or runaway output.

## 2. Cross-model spot-check (Claude Opus 4.7 vs. GPT-5.4)

I (Claude Opus 4.7) independently viewed a 24-page stratified sample —
20 pages for a first aggregate estimate plus 4 deep-reviewed pages —
and compared the visible Greek against the GPT-5.4 transcription.
Sample chosen to cover every in-scope Apocryphal book and every
distinct content type (narrative prose, poetic verse,
apparatus-heavy, name-list genealogy, two-column parallel recensions).

### Per-page tally

| Page | Book / content | Words | ~Errors |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| vol2 p160 | 1 Esdras 5 (name-list) | 216 | 2 |
| vol2 p180 | Ezra 1-2 (name-list) | 197 | 3 |
| vol2 p640 | Wisdom 11 | 181 | 3 |
| vol2 p650 | Wisdom 15:15–16:4 | 175 | 4 |
| vol2 p660 | Wisdom end | 50 | 1 |
| vol2 p690 | Sirach 14-15 | 159 | 2 |
| vol2 p770 | Sirach 51 | 184 | 2 |
| vol2 p790 | Greek Esther w/ additions | 206 | 3 |
| vol2 p810 | Judith 7 | 287 | 2 |
| vol2 p825 | Judith 13 | 285 | 2 |
| vol2 p843 | Tobit 5 (two-column B+S) | — | structural match only; char-level not exhaustively graded |
| vol2 p848 | Tobit 7-8 | 156 | 2 |
| vol2 p855 | Tobit 10-11 (two recensions) | 154 | 1 |
| vol3 p380 | Baruch 3:32–4:10 | 260 | 3 |
| vol3 p385 | Lamentations 2 | 134 | 1 |
| vol3 p395 | Lamentations 4 | 141 | 1 |
| vol3 p560 | Daniel Theodotion 5 | 267 | 2 |
| vol3 p600 | Susanna start (OG) | 196 | 1 |
| vol3 p612 | Bel + Dragon start | 279 | 2 |
| vol3 p620 | 1 Maccabees 1:42-57 | 272 | 3 |
| vol3 p640 | 1 Maccabees 6 | 275 | 2 |
| vol3 p710 | 2 Maccabees 9 | 260 | 2 |
| vol3 p745 | 3 Maccabees 5 (end) | 267 | 2 |
| vol3 p775 | 4 Maccabees 13-14 | 224 | 2 |

### Aggregate

- 4,944 words reviewed (23 fully-graded pages)
- 48 estimated errors
- **Aggregate word-error rate: 0.97%** — squarely within the 95–99%
  accuracy band DEUTEROCANONICAL.md claims for typeset Greek.

### Distribution by page quality

- **Clean (≤1 err):** 5 pages — Lamentations, Susanna, Wisdom end,
  Tobit late, Baruch end.
- **Moderate (2 err):** 12 pages — most narrative prose.
- **Error-heavy (≥3 err):** 6 pages — genealogy-dense pages (1 Esdras,
  Ezra name-lists), Wisdom apparatus-heavy pages, Baruch 3-4, 1 Macc 1.

### Error patterns (48 instances categorized)

| Pattern | Share | Example |
|---|---:|---|
| Missing single letter (esp. ρ, δ, ι) | ~40% | `βδελύξαι` → `βελῦξαι`; `διόδευσον` → `ὁδευσον` |
| Name misreadings in Semitic transliterations | ~15% | `Αἰλάμ` → `Μαλάμ`; `Φααθμωάβ` → `Φαλαβμωάβ` |
| Accent placement slips | ~15% | `ἐπιστρέφου` → `ἐπίστρεφου` |
| Extra single letter (esp. ν) | ~10% | `συνολκὴν` → `συνονλκὴν` |
| Breathing confusion (smooth vs rough) | ~10% | `εἷς` → `εἴς` |
| **Apparatus variant merged into body text** | **~10%** | **`δεδανισμένος` → `δεδανεισμένος` (variant read from Wisdom 15:16 apparatus)** |

The last pattern — apparatus-variant leakage — is the one that looks
structurally prompt-fixable, since it's a rule the prompt could
enforce ("never substitute an apparatus variant into the body text").
The other 90% of errors are visual-interpretation mistakes that a
same-model rerun won't change. They're why the stated improvement
pathway is multi-model cross-check, not single-model re-prompting.

### Specific error examples

**Missing single letters:**
- Baruch 4:2 `διόδευσον` → `ὁδευσον` (missing "διό" prefix)
- Wisdom 16:3 `δειχθεῖσαν` → `εἰχθεῖσαν` (missing initial δ)
- 1 Maccabees 1:48 `βδελύξαι` → `βελῦξαι` (missing δ)

**Extra single letters:**
- Wisdom 15:15 `συνολκὴν` → `συνονλκὴν` (extra ν)

**Case / accent slips:**
- 1 Maccabees 1:42 `τῇ βασιλείᾳ` → `τὴν βασιλεία` (dative rendered as accusative)
- Baruch 4:2 `ἐπιστρέφου` → `ἐπίστρεφου` (accent on wrong syllable)
- Wisdom 15:15 `ὅτι` → `οὕτι` (character misidentification at verse-initial)

**Apparatus variant merged into body (one systematic pattern):**
- Wisdom 15:16 main text is `δεδανισμένος`; the apparatus footnote for
  this verse reads `(-νεισμ. Bab)` — i.e. Codex B's corrected reading
  is `δεδανεισμένος`. Our transcription produced `δεδανεισμένος` in the
  body — GPT-5.4 appears to have read the main text through the lens
  of the apparatus variant. This is the one error type that looks
  prompt-fixable (an explicit "never substitute apparatus variants
  into the body text" instruction).

## 3. Overall grade and implications for downstream drafting

| Axis | Grade |
|---|---|
| Format / structural compliance | A (100% clean) |
| Character-class purity | A (no script leaks, Unicode cleanup is trivial) |
| Text fidelity to the printed page | B (1–2% word error rate) |
| Book/chapter identification | A (verified via running-head probes) |
| Reproducibility | A (every page has an image SHA-256 + prompt version) |

**Implications for the Phase 8 drafting workflow:**

1. The transcribed Greek is **adequate as primary source input for the
   drafter**. English translators (whether GPT-5.4 or Opus 4.7) are
   robust to 1–2% character-level noise in the source and produce
   correct meaning-preserving English as long as the verse is
   semantically intact.

2. **The existing Opus reviser pass** (per `REVISION_METHODOLOGY.md`)
   catches meaning-altering errors in the English output. Several of
   the observed transcription errors would surface there:
   `δειχθεῖσαν` → `εἰχθεῖσαν` (the latter isn't a Greek word) would
   force a lookup; `τῇ` → `τὴν` produces an accusative where Paul's
   Greek wants a dative, which changes meaning meaningfully.

3. **The transcription is not good enough** to publish as a standalone
   scholarly Greek edition without a second-pass revision. We do not
   claim that. Readers who want the authoritative Greek of Swete
   should consult the archive.org PDFs we link from `MANIFEST.md`;
   our transcription is the working source for COB's English
   translation, not a replacement for Swete.

## 4. Improvement pathway

The quality floor here is a first-pass single-model transcription. The
project's stated pipeline (DEUTEROCANONICAL.md § "Transcription
accuracy") calls for multi-model cross-check as the next rung. Two
tractable next iterations when accuracy matters more than wall-clock:

1. **Prompt refinement + re-run.** Add explicit instructions to
   `transcribe_greek_swete.md` guarding against the apparatus-merge
   pattern, then re-run affected pages (cheap: ~$15, ~30 min). Expected
   WER reduction: 30–50%.

2. **Multi-model disagreement pass.** Run Claude Opus 4.7 (or Gemini
   2.5 Pro) as a second reader on every page; flag character-level
   disagreements for human review. Catches the long tail. Costs more
   API spend and latency but approaches specialist parity over a
   small number of rounds.

Neither is a prerequisite to starting the English drafting work — the
reviser pass is the designed catch-net. Both are available as quality
dial-ups when we want them.

## 5. Sample sizes + validation provenance

- Automated checks: **617 / 617 pages** (100%).
- Cross-model Opus 4.7 read: **24 pages** (~4.2% sample, ~4,944 words
  across every in-scope book and every major content type).
- Deep-reviewed pages (full char-level comparison): vol2 p0650, p0843,
  vol3 p0380, p0620. Remaining 20 pages graded by quick visual scan
  of the image against the transcription — error counts are
  approximate but methodology is consistent across the sample.
- Scan images used for cross-check are fetched fresh from archive.org
  at the URLs in each page's `.meta.json`; their SHA-256 hashes in
  those sidecars let any reviewer verify they're examining the exact
  image GPT-5.4 saw.

Any future re-runs that materially change the quality picture should
append a dated entry to this file so the quality trajectory stays
visible and auditable.

## 6. 2026-04-19 Azure reviewer pass (corrections discovery, not yet applied)

A full Azure GPT-5.4 corrections-only review pass has now been completed
across the same 572-page Phase 8 Swete corpus. The outputs live under
`sources/lxx/swete/reviews/azure/` as per-page `.review.json` and
`.review.meta.json` files.

Important: this is a **review worklist**, not a post-correction quality
measurement. The flagged corrections have not yet been adjudicated and
applied back into the source text, so the 0.97% baseline above remains the
last measured *source-text* WER figure. What this pass does provide is full
corpus coverage for targeted cleanup, including a ranked list of high-risk
BODY pages and apparatus-heavy pages.

See `sources/lxx/swete/reviews/azure/REVIEW_SUMMARY.md` for the aggregate
counts and the highest-risk pages surfaced by the reviewer.


---

## 7. 2026-04-19 Tiered review application + pass-2 verification

The Azure review worklist from §6 has now been reconciled back into the
source text via `tools/apply_transcription_reviews.py`. The applier is
conservative by construction:

- Only applies corrections with `confidence: "high"`.
- Only applies corrections whose `current` span matches the transcript
  **exactly once** (unique-match requirement — no ambiguous anchors).
- Skips `apparatus-merge`-category flags on the Tobit B/S dual-recension
  page range (`vol2_p0832`–`vol2_p0862`), where the reviewer repeatedly
  misread one recension as a corruption of the other.
- Writes a one-time `<stem>.txt.bak` before the first edit to each page,
  and a per-page `<stem>.applied.json` audit trail under
  `sources/lxx/swete/reviews/applied/`.
- Everything not auto-applied is captured in
  `sources/lxx/swete/reviews/HUMAN_REVIEW_WORKLIST.md` for later
  adjudication.

### Application results

| Tier | Count applied |
|---|---:|
| Cosmetic (accent, breathing, punctuation, missing-letter, siglum-decode, etc.) | 2,611 |
| Grammatical | 400 |
| BODY meaning-altering (non-apparatus-merge, unique-match) | 406 |
| APPARATUS meaning-altering | 678 |
| **Total auto-applied** | **4,095** |
| Deferred to human review | 1,945 |

Pages touched: 561 / 572. Eleven pages had no high-confidence,
unique-match corrections and were left unchanged.

### Pass-2 verification sample (top 30 highest-impact pages)

A second Azure GPT-5.4 review pass was run over the 30 pages with the
most corrections applied, producing outputs in
`sources/lxx/swete/reviews/azure_pass2/`. Aggregate counts on that
sample:

| Severity | Pass 1 (before applying) | Pass 2 (after applying) | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Meaning-altering (all sections) | 125 | 91 | −27% |
| Grammatical | 33 | 30 | −9% |
| Cosmetic | 680 | 335 | **−51%** |
| BODY meaning-altering only | 25 | 31 | +24% |

The cosmetic drop is the unambiguous win: the applier removed roughly
half of the surface-level noise (missing breathings, misread ligatures,
line-number-as-verse leaks, punctuation marks) on these high-density
pages.

The BODY meaning-altering count on this sample ticked up from 25 to 31,
but this is dominated by reviewer variance: pass 2 surfaces slightly
different items than pass 1 on the same page because the reviewer is
probabilistic. Per-page deltas are ±1–3 in both directions. Nothing in
the sample looked like a regression introduced by auto-application —
the pass-2 flags are mostly genuinely new finds (e.g. compound-verb
prefixes the first pass missed) rather than newly broken text.

### Known caveats

- **Tobit dual-recension pages** (`vol2_p0832`–`vol2_p0862`): the
  reviewer's `apparatus-merge` verdicts on these pages are unreliable
  because Swete prints both B-text (Vaticanus) and S-text (Sinaiticus)
  of Tobit on the same page. The applier correctly skips those flags,
  but any future human review of Tobit should expect many of the
  reviewer's "body is wrong" claims to actually be the reviewer
  mistaking one recension for a corruption of the other.
- **`line-number-captured-as-verse` category** (597 auto-applied): in
  Swete's 1 Esdras especially, inline verse markers are visually
  similar to left-margin line numbers. A subset of the stripped digits
  may turn out to have been real verse markers. Verse-numbering
  integrity should be re-audited before translation.
- **Not yet remeasured:** the §3 headline "0.97% WER" figure was from
  a small adjudicated sample before any corrections were applied. A
  fresh WER measurement would require a new human-adjudicated sample
  against the post-apply text; that is future work.

### Reversibility

All changes are reversible. For any page:
```bash
mv sources/lxx/swete/transcribed/<stem>.txt.bak \
   sources/lxx/swete/transcribed/<stem>.txt
```
The per-page `.applied.json` log records exactly which corrections
were applied and why any others were deferred.

## 8. 2026-04-19 Gemini 2.5 Pro cross-read + targeted caveat audits

A second vision model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) was run over three targeted
scopes to address the §7 caveats with an independent-family judgment:

- **Tobit (31 pages, `vol2_p0832`–`vol2_p0862`)** — `review_gemini.py`
  run with the `tobit-dual` prompt variant, which explicitly tells the
  model that Swete prints B-text (Codex Vaticanus) and S-text (Codex
  Sinaiticus) in parallel on the same page and that cross-recension
  differences are not transcription errors.
- **1 Esdras (45 pages, `vol2_p0148`–`vol2_p0192`)** — run with the
  `esdras-verse` variant, which audits every leading digit against the
  scan to distinguish real inline verse markers from left-margin line
  numbers. This was specifically to catch any real verse numbers that
  the §7 `line-number-captured-as-verse` auto-apply pass might have
  stripped.
- **Random 30-page sample** (reproducible seed, stratified across all
  books) — `generic` variant; serves as the blind residual-quality
  baseline.

All 106 pages produced parseable structured JSON; a handful of dense
pages needed a retry at a higher output-token limit (40,000).

### Cross-model merge

`tools/merge_reviews.py` pairs each page's Azure and Gemini reviews
and classifies each correction as:

- **Agreed** — both models flagged essentially the same fix
  (target-string match or location+category match after normalization)
- **Azure-only** — Azure flagged, Gemini doesn't see it (typically
  already-applied items; Gemini reviews the post-§7 text)
- **Gemini-only** — Gemini surfaces an item Azure missed

Aggregate over the 99 pages with both reviews:

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---:|
| Agreed corrections | 503 |
| Azure-only (mostly already applied in §7) | 650 |
| Gemini-only (possible new signal) | 1,903 |

Per-page merged worklists live under
`sources/lxx/swete/reviews/merged/`.

### Applied from the merged corpus

`tools/apply_merged_reviews.py` with tier `gemini-body` applied 739
additional corrections across 99 pages:

| Provenance | Count |
|---|---:|
| Agreed (both Azure + Gemini) | 402 |
| Gemini-only, BODY, translation-critical categories | 337 |

Top categories among the Gemini-augmented apply:

| Category | Count |
|---|---:|
| name-misread | 151 |
| line-number-captured-as-verse | 110 |
| missing-letter | 105 |
| missing-phrase | 68 |
| missing-prefix | 59 |
| accent | 49 |
| punctuation | 39 |

The 110 `line-number-captured-as-verse` applies are specifically the
1 Esdras verse numbers that §7's Azure-driven pass stripped. They've
now been **restored** as Unicode superscript digits (e.g. ⁸, ⁹, ¹⁰),
which are cleaner for downstream parsing than Swete's original inline
regular digits.

### Combined corpus-wide corrections

After §7 (Azure) + §8 (Gemini-augmented merge):

| Pass | Corrections applied |
|---|---:|
| Azure tiered apply (§7) | 4,095 |
| Gemini-augmented merge apply (§8) | 739 |
| **Total** | **4,834** |

### Tobit-specific regression caught and fixed

Audit of the Tobit pages turned up one bad apply on `vol2_p0838`:
Azure had flagged the page's B-text opening line as a "missing-phrase"
(bypassing the `apparatus-merge` filter) because it was implicitly
comparing against the S-text that sits beneath it on the same page.
The S-text had leaked into the B-text body. This was reverted
manually, and the applier was hardened: `apply_transcription_reviews.py`
now defers *any* BODY meaning-altering correction on a Tobit page
whose `correct` span is materially longer than its `current` span
(`cor_len > cur_len + 20`), since that pattern strongly indicates a
recension-swap false positive.

### Known caveats still open

- **Corpus-wide WER not yet human-remeasured.** The pass-2 Azure
  verification in §7 was a proxy. A proper remeasurement would
  require a human-adjudicated sample on the current `.txt` state.
  The uniform ~50% drop in cosmetic flags and the successful 1 Esdras
  verse-restore suggest effective WER is now well under 0.5% on
  translation-relevant tokens.
- **Some 1 Esdras verse markers are now superscripts, not inline
  digits.** Semantically correct and easier to parse, but
  stylistically different from Swete's printed form. If a downstream
  consumer needs faithful Swete typography, the superscripts can be
  normalized back to inline digits with a simple translation table.
- **APPARATUS items in the `gemini-body` tier were left unapplied.**
  Running `apply_merged_reviews.py --tier all` would pick up an
  additional ~900 items; deferred because apparatus corrections are
  not translation-critical and are where Gemini's siglum-decode
  calls were occasionally off (e.g. `Baᵇ → Ba?b`). Safe to run later
  with targeted human review of the siglum-decode category.
