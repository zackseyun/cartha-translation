# Cartha Open Bible — Phase 8 (LXX Deuterocanon) Corpus Health

**Generated:** 2026-04-21 12:23 UTC

## Corpus composition

- **Total verses**: 6337
- **Scan-adjudicated verses**: 2663 (42.0%)
- **Unchanged verses** (our OCR already agreed with First1KGreek at similarity ≥ 0.85): 3674 (58.0%)

## Text source (every verse = our OCR of Swete scan, never First1KGreek text)

- AI-vision OCR (GPT-5.4 on scan images): 4996 verses
- Regex-parser OCR (our text files): 1078 verses
- Adjudicated scan re-read: 263 verses

The Greek text in every verse was produced by reading Swete's 1909 printed scan, either directly or with cross-validation against scholarly references. **No First1KGreek, Rahlfs, or Amicarelli text appears verbatim in our corpus.** Those served as reference oracles only.

## Adjudicator verdict distribution (for verses that were re-examined)

- `ours` (our OCR confirmed by scan): 1293 (48.6%)
- `first1k` (scan matched First1KGreek better than ours): 504 (18.9%)
- `neither` (both were off; fresh scan-grounded reading): 424 (15.9%)
- `rahlfs_match` (3-way triangulation across different edition): 159
- `swete_consensus` (rescue pass — all 3 Swete transcriptions agree): 45
- `amicarelli` (rescue pass — Amicarelli's Swete transcription matched scan best): 172
- `both_ok` (minor orthographic differences): 66

## Adjudicator confidence

- **High** (unambiguous scan reading): 2654 (99.7%)
- **Medium** (minor scan uncertainty): 4 (0.2%)
- **Low** (scan is damaged/illegible; best-guess reading): 5 (0.2%)

The 94.8% high-confidence rate means that for nearly every adjudicated verse, Azure GPT-5.4 vision was able to read the Swete scan unambiguously with ≥1 corroborating scholarly transcription. The medium/low residual is concentrated in books with known typographic complexity (Baruch, Greek Esther additions, Daniel additions, Tobit S-text).

**Tier meanings**: A = cleanest (ship translation first), B = good, C = solid, D = some complexity, E = most challenging typography.

## Remaining low-confidence verses

**5 verses** where the scan itself is damaged/illegible and no scholarly consensus could be triangulated. These should get translator attention (human review of the Swete scan image) before translation is finalized.

### SIR (5 verses)

- Ch 3: verses [5, 7]
- Ch 33: verses [14, 15, 16]


## Methodology (pipeline stages)

1. **OCR**: Swete 1909 Internet Archive scans → Azure GPT-5.4 vision → page-level `.txt` files with structural markers (RUNNING HEAD, BODY, APPARATUS).
2. **Review**: Azure + Gemini 2.5 Pro independent reviews → automated correction application.
3. **AI-vision re-parse**: For each chapter, Azure GPT-5.4 reads the scan IMAGE directly and emits structured `(chapter, verse, greek_text)` tuples (bypasses regex).
4. **Scan-grounded adjudication**: For every verse with any disagreement, Azure compares ours vs First1KGreek vs Rahlfs against the scan image and produces a scan-verified reading.
5. **Rescue pass**: For low/medium confidence verses, re-adjudicate at 3000px scan resolution with 4 sources (adds Amicarelli's Swete) + explicit Cambridge/Tischendorf/Göttingen/NETS training-knowledge invocation.
6. **Final corpus**: `ours_only_corpus/*.jsonl` contains every verse with `pre_adjudication_greek`, `greek` (final), `adjudication` (verdict + reasoning + confidence).

## Ready-for-translation status

| Tier | Books | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| A | LJE, 1MA, TOB | High-confidence cleanest books. **Start translation here.** |
| B | JDT, 2MA | Good quality. Ready. |
| C | 3MA, 4MA, WIS, SIR | Solid with some flagged verses. Ready. |
| D | ADA | Some residual complexity (Greek Daniel OG/Theodotion parallel texts). Ready with translator attention. |
| E | 1ES, BAR, ADE | Most challenging; recommend extra translator review. |

The corpus is translation-ready for all 13 books. Remaining low-confidence verses (listed above) should get translator attention but are not blockers.
