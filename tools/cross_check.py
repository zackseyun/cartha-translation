"""
cross_check.py — Run a verse draft through Claude, GPT, and Gemini in
parallel, compute agreement scores, and flag divergences for human review.

Pipeline stage 3 of the Cartha Open Bible methodology. Takes a verse
YAML produced by draft.py and augments it with cross-check results.

Usage:

    python tools/cross_check.py translation/nt/philippians/001/001.yaml

Environment:

    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY        required for Claude
    OPENAI_API_KEY           required for GPT
    GOOGLE_API_KEY           required for Gemini

Agreement thresholds (per METHODOLOGY.md Stage 3):
- >= 0.90: human review proceeds directly.
- 0.75-0.90: human reviewer must reconcile divergences.
- <  0.75: escalate to review board discussion (public GitHub issue).

This skeleton is intentionally functional but unimplemented — wiring up
OpenAI + Google SDKs with the same tool schema pattern used in draft.py,
then scoring agreement via normalized edit distance on english_text
plus Jaccard overlap on lexical_decisions, is tracked as a follow-up.
