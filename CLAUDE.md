# CLAUDE.md — Cartha Open Bible (working notes for agents)

Conventions for AI agents (or humans) working in this repo.

## Cross-platform parity (READ THIS FIRST when touching the reader)

The COB reading experience ships on **mobile (Flutter)** and **website (Next.js)**. Every feature must mirror across both surfaces. The map of what file mirrors what, the canonical analytics vocabulary, and the "add a feature" checklist live in:

**[docs/COB_CROSS_PLATFORM_PARITY.md](docs/COB_CROSS_PLATFORM_PARITY.md)**

Update that doc in the same change set whenever you add, rename, or remove a COB surface on either platform.

## Commit style

- **No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer on any commit.** This repo's
  history is public-facing — keep it attributed cleanly to the human
  maintainers. Remove the trailer from any existing commit if it slips
  in.
- Commit subjects for revision-pass work start with one of these verbs
  so the public status dashboard can filter them: `revise`, `polish`,
  `normalize`, `rename`, `consistency`. Drafting commits don't use these
  prefixes.

## Regenerating `status.json`

`status.json` at the repo root is the snapshot that powers the public
[translation progress page](https://cartha.com/cartha-open-bible/progress).
It's committed like any other file — there is no server, no cron. The
cartha.website frontend fetches it directly from GitHub's raw CDN and
pins each coverage number to the `commit_sha` embedded in the file.

**When to regenerate:**

- After merging a batch of drafting work.
- After a revision pass or a normalization pass.
- Before any announcement that quotes progress numbers.

**How to regenerate:**

```bash
python3 tools/build_status.py
git add status.json
git commit -m "status: regenerate snapshot"
git push
```

The script walks `translation/` + runs `git log --` against the
`translation/` path. It does not parse YAML contents — all signals are
derived from directory structure and commit subjects, so a cold run is
well under a second.

**Pin caveat:** the `commit_sha` embedded in `status.json` is the HEAD
at generation time, which is one commit behind the commit that adds the
status.json itself. That's correct: the snapshot reflects the repo
state *as of* the pinned SHA, before the snapshot was committed.

**Schema:** see `tools/build_status.py` for the authoritative shape.
Bump `schema_version` when adding fields the frontend must branch on.

## Regenerating `revisions.json`

`revisions.json` powers the public [revisions page](https://cartha.com/cartha-open-bible/revisions).
It carries two distinct signals:

1. **Applied edits** (the `revisions:` array on each verse YAML) —
   visible to anyone with the repo, regenerable on GitHub Actions.
2. **Review-pass coverage** (every verdict from `state/reviews/**`,
   including "agree" verdicts where no edit was applied) — this is the
   honest answer to "how many verses got a second pair of eyes." Lives
   only on the maintainer's Mac because `state/` is gitignored.

If you regenerate from a tree without `state/reviews/` populated
(GitHub Actions, a fresh clone), the script preserves whatever
`review_coverage` block was last published rather than overwriting it
with zeros.

**The flywheel** (lives on the maintainer's Mac, see
`scripts/com.cartha.cob-revisions-flywheel.plist`):

```bash
# install once:
cp scripts/cob-revisions-flywheel.sh ~/scripts/
cp scripts/com.cartha.cob-revisions-flywheel.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cartha.cob-revisions-flywheel.plist
```

It runs every 30 min, regenerates `revisions.json`, and pushes if any
counts changed (with `pull --rebase --autostash` to coexist with the
hourly `regen-status.yml` workflow). Logs at
`/tmp/cob-revisions-flywheel-stdout.log`.

**Manual one-shot:**
```bash
python3 tools/build_revisions_index.py
git add revisions.json && git commit -m "revisions: regenerate" && git push
```

## Publishing to clients — CDN pipeline

The website and mobile apps do **not** read this repo directly for
Bible text. They both pull a compiled JSON snapshot from the CDN at
`https://bible.cartha.com`. The pipeline is:

```
main (committed drafts)
   ↓  (scripts/publish_cob.sh)
Lambda: cartha-cob-publisher
   ↓
bible.cartha.com/manifest.json   (tiny, revalidated on each read)
bible.cartha.com/cob_preview.json (large body, cache-busted by manifest.version)
   ↓                    ↓
website bibleData.js    mobile CobRuntimeSync
```

Clients compare their cached version sha to `manifest.version`; if
different, they fetch the new body. Nothing ships to clients until
the Lambda runs.

**To force-refresh what clients see from whatever is on `main` right
now:**

```bash
scripts/sync_cob.sh                 # cherry-pick any ready jobs + push + publish
scripts/sync_cob.sh --publish-only  # just re-publish whatever is already on main
scripts/sync_cob.sh --merge-only    # cherry-pick + push, skip publish
```

This is the one-shot manual equivalent of `scripts/supervise_merge.sh`.
Use it after a revision pass, after a direct commit to `main`, or any
time you suspect the CDN has drifted behind `main`.

**Autonomous alternative:** `scripts/master_supervisor.sh` keeps
translation workers, the merge supervisor, and OT summary prewarmers
all alive in a loop. It exits when the queue drains. Pause with
`touch /tmp/cob-stop-supervisor`; stop fully with `pkill -f
master_supervisor.sh`. There is deliberately no launchd plist — this
is a finite project and running as a daemon encourages forgetting to
stop it.

**Landmine that bit us on 2026-04-19 — don't reintroduce:** the
earlier version of `tools/chapter_merge.py` used
`git branch --contains <sha>` to decide whether a draft commit was
"already on main." That returns true if *any* branch — including the
`codex/*` per-worktree branches — contains the sha, so it silently
marked 357 uncherrypicked drafts as merged and the CDN stayed on 42
of 66 canonical books while the SQL claimed 100% completion. The
correct check, now in place, is
`git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> HEAD`. If you change the merge
script, keep that check or an equivalent that pins to `main`
specifically.

## Public pages that depend on this repo

The cartha.website frontend reads three live endpoints from this
repo's `main` branch:

- `status.json` — the status dashboard.
- `translation/<testament>/<slug>/<NNN>/<VVV>.yaml` — per-verse
  provenance page at `/cartha-open-bible/verse?ref=<CODE>.<CH>.<V>`.
- The issue tracker at `github.com/zackseyun/cartha-open-bible/issues`
  — the Suggest Revision form in the reader opens a prefilled GitHub
  issue, so labels/policies defined there shape what users see.

Changing directory layout or file schema breaks those pages. If you
restructure, update the consuming code in the cartha.website repo
(`src/app/(main)/cartha-open-bible/`) in the same change set.
