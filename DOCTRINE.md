# Translation Stance

This document states the translation commitments that guide every
decision in the Cartha Open Bible. Declaring them is an act of
honesty: critics can assess our output against our stated
commitments rather than guessing at hidden biases.

## Theological stance

The Cartha Open Bible does not commit to a specific denominational
or creedal doctrinal stance. Where the source texts presuppose
theological claims — the divinity of Christ, the resurrection,
the personhood of the Holy Spirit, the unity of God — the
translation reflects those claims as the texts present them, not
as imposed commitments of the translator.

Readers from any tradition (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Protestant
of any stripe, non-denominational, inquirer) are invited to
evaluate COB against their own framework. Where a translation
decision is influenced by a theological reading — for example,
where a Greek construction is genuinely ambiguous and the English
choice leans one way or the other — that choice is documented in
the verse's `theological_decisions` block and the alternative
rendering is preserved in a footnote.

We do not pick sides on denominational distinctives (Reformed vs.
Arminian, infant vs. believer's baptism, real presence vs.
symbolic, cessationist vs. continuationist, etc.). Those questions
are for the reader and their faith community, not for the
translation.

## Translation philosophy

The Cartha Open Bible aims at **optimal equivalence**: a middle
path between formal ("word-for-word") and dynamic
("thought-for-thought") approaches.

Specifically:

1. **Original-language primacy over translation tradition.** Where
   long-standing English renderings reflect translation-tradition
   inertia rather than the source text's plain sense, we favor the
   source. Example: translating *doulos* as "slave" rather than
   "servant" in contexts where the term's bonded nature is
   theologically salient (Rom 1:1, Phil 1:1).

2. **Translate titles; transliterate names.** Christological
   titles are translated to preserve meaning (*Christos* →
   "Messiah", not "Christ" where context supports; *Kyrios* →
   "Lord"). Personal names are transliterated by standard
   conventions.

3. **Preserve theological tension rather than resolve it.** Where
   the source is genuinely ambiguous on a contested interpretive
   question (e.g., *pistis Christou* — "faith in Christ" vs.
   "faithfulness of Christ"), we render one in the main text and
   preserve the alternative in a footnote, documenting the
   decision in the per-verse YAML.

4. **Consistency of key terms, or documented exception.** A given
   Greek or Hebrew word should receive a consistent English gloss
   across the translation, unless context demands variance — in
   which case the variance is documented per-verse with a
   rationale. The `consistency_lint.py` tool enforces this at
   commit time.

5. **Readable modern English, not archaic or academic.** The
   target reader is a literate 18–35-year-old English speaker.
   Vocabulary should be accessible without flattening theological
   weight. We avoid both ecclesiastical jargon ("propitiation" is
   footnoted, not required) and informality that undersells the
   text's gravity.

## Contested terms

The following terms appear frequently and carry heavy theological
weight. Our default rendering and rationale are recorded here.
Per-verse variance is documented in the individual YAML files.

| Greek / Hebrew | Default English | Alternatives considered | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Χριστός *Christos* | Messiah (where title; Christ where name-like) | Christ | Preserves Hebraic messianic context |
| κύριος *Kyrios* | Lord | LORD, Master | Matches covenantal and NT usage |
| δοῦλος *doulos* | slave (where bonded nature is salient) / servant | bondservant | Uses "slave" where ownership/service is theologically active |
| πίστις *pistis* | faith | faithfulness, trust | Main text: faith; footnote alternatives where contested |
| δικαιοσύνη *dikaiosynē* | righteousness | justice | Both renderings preserved in footnotes for Pauline passages |
| ἱλαστήριον *hilastērion* | atoning sacrifice | propitiation, mercy seat | Dynamic rendering for accessibility; alternatives footnoted |
| ἀγάπη *agapē* | love | charity (archaic) | Lexical cognates in source kept |
| σάρξ *sarx* | flesh (literal) / sinful nature (metaphorical) | — | Context-dependent; per-verse documented |
| μετανοέω *metanoeō* | change of mind / change your thinking (cognitive contexts); repent (specific-sin contexts) | repent (traditional) | See REVISION_METHODOLOGY.md §"μετανοέω → change of mind" for the per-context rule |
| νήφω *nēphō* | clear-minded (most contexts); sober (where Paul explicitly runs the drunk/sober metaphor) | sober-minded | See revision notes in 1 Pet 5:8, 1 Thess 5:6 |
| יְהוָה YHWH | Yahweh | the LORD, Jehovah | Renders the divine name as a name. Where the NT quotes an OT YHWH passage using *Kyrios*, the NT verse retains "Lord" to preserve the Greek; the OT source verse uses "Yahweh". |
| אָדָם *adam* | man / humankind (context) | — | Context-dependent per usage |

## What the translation is not

To prevent misunderstanding:

- **Not a paraphrase.** Every English rendering is tied to a
  specific source-text word or phrase, documented in the per-verse
  YAML.
- **Not a study Bible.** Footnotes document translation decisions,
  not doctrinal application or devotional commentary.
- **Not a denominational product.** The translation is
  intentionally cross-denominational. Contested readings are
  preserved in footnotes, not smoothed away.
- **Not a finalized translation.** Every verse is currently an
  AI-drafted rendering, released openly with full rationale. There
  is no formal scholarly review process at this time.
- **Not a first-century English approximation.** We aim at modern
  English that honors source-language meaning, not at archaism.

## Translating into other languages

The Cartha Open Bible's long-term intention is to be translated
into every major world language. Scripture belongs to the whole
church; producing COB only in English would contradict the
project's mission.

Each target language is its own translation — drafted directly
from the original-language sources (Hebrew OT, Greek NT, Swete
LXX for the deuterocanonical books) rather than from the English
COB. Translating from English would compound the distance from the
originals and inherit choices that make sense in English but not
elsewhere. Every target language deserves its own encounter with
the Hebrew and Greek.

Each language goes through **several revision passes** before it
is considered stable:

1. **AI-drafted first pass** — a frontier multilingual model
   produces the initial verse-by-verse draft with full per-verse
   provenance, following the same methodology used for English
   (DOCTRINE.md translation philosophy §§1–5, per-verse YAML
   schema, `doctrine_reference` citations where relevant).
2. **AI-reviewer revision** — a second, distinct model reads the
   draft and flags awkward phrasing, dropped nuance, or places
   where the target language's idiom has drifted from the
   source's force. Revisions are discrete commits.
3. **Native-speaker community review** — before a language is
   declared stable, speakers of that language who are also
   familiar with the biblical source languages (or who have
   access to published lexicons in that language) audit the
   text and raise issues publicly.
4. **Public issue window** — a minimum public-review period with
   open GitHub issues before any language moves from "preview"
   to "stable."

**Supported languages will be disclosed publicly based on model
performance and feasibility.** Not every language has an AI model
capable of scholarly-accurate translation yet, and not every
language has a sufficient community of native-speaking reviewers
accessible to the project. We will publish the current supported-
language list, and the ready-but-not-yet-stable list, as we reach
the capability threshold for each. Languages that do not yet meet
the bar are named as such, not silently omitted.

Every language published under this program carries the same
CC-BY 4.0 license, the same per-verse provenance, the same
auditability. There is no tier system across languages — every
supported language gets the full Cartha Open Bible.

## Change log for this document

Material changes to this document are themselves commits. Prior
versions of the stance are preserved in git history.

- **2026-04-21:** Removed creedal affirmations (Apostles' Creed,
  Nicene Creed, Chalcedonian Definition) and replaced with a
  theological-stance section that declines specific creedal
  commitment. Translation philosophy and contested-terms table
  preserved unchanged; those are methodology, not creedal
  commitment, and the project actually runs on them. Added a
  "Translating into other languages" section stating COB's long-
  term intention to ship in every feasible major language, with
  the full revision pipeline and transparent supported-language
  disclosure. Per-verse YAML citing the old `doctrine_reference`
  values is preserved as historical record; those are not
  retroactively edited.
